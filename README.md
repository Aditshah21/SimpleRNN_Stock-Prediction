# SimpleRNN_Stock-Prediction
A simple recurrent neural network which predicts the stock price on basis of last 5 years data.

A simple recuurent neural network which predicts the images based on input

So, I have make this simple RNN network to make predictions for stock price of Google. I am taking this course on Udemy called Deep Learning A-Z.

From this program, you'll be able to understand how to build a RNN from scratch with data preprocessing and data visualization and building neural network. Don't forget to download all necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras,Panda,MAtplotlib and Numpy. Enjoy! #GoogleColab
